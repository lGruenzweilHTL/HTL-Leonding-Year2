<h1>Sample Questions - Basic Web Techniques</h1>
<h2>History</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <li><strong>Invention of the Web:</strong> Tim Berners-Lee developed the web at CERN to easily store, update, and
        distribute documents (1989).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Approach and Concepts:</strong>

    <li>Avoidance of tree structures and keywords.</li>
    <li>Use of the ENQUIRE system from 1980.</li>
    <li>Ted Nelson's Hypertext model as a foundation.</li>

    <li><strong>HyperCard:</strong> Apple's HyperCard was popular, but Berners-Lee's system supported multiple databases
        and users worldwide.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Extended Features:</strong>

    <li>Support for multimedia (graphics, video, etc.).</li>
    <li>Dynamic links for mutable data.</li>
    <li>Gateways for access to other systems.</li>
    <li>Decentralization without central control.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Word Wide Web General</h2>
<ol class="list">
    <li>
        <strong>What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?</strong>

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?</strong>
        <p>Resources are addressed using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What are the general components of a url?</strong>
        <p>The general components of a URL are the scheme (protocol), host (domain), port (optional), path, query

</ol>

<h2>Web Server</h2>
<ol class="list">
    <li>

            function is to deliver web content or services to end-users.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>How can content be stored on a web server?</strong>
        <p>Content can be stored on a web server in the form of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) or generated
            dynamically by server-side scripts (PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>How is content in webpages described?</strong>
        <p>Content in webpages is described using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Web Client</h2>
<ol class="list">
    <li>
        <strong>What is a web client?</strong>
        <p>A web client, commonly known as a web browser, is a software application used to access and interact with

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What does a web client do?</strong>
        <p>A web client requests resources from web servers, renders the content, allows user interaction, implements

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Are Web Client and Web Browser the same?</strong>
        <p>No, they are not quite the same. A web browser is a type of web client specifically designed to retrieve,
