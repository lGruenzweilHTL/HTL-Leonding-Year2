We will do a quiz during one of the next lessons where you can prove that you read the given texts carefully. For this quiz and all the following ones you can use your CheatSheet. 
## Hint
A sample entry of your cheat sheet should look like as follows:

```html
meta <meta charset="utf8" />
```
## **Explanation**
In HTML, `<` is an **HTML entity** that represents the **less-than symbol** (`<`). HTML entities are used to display special characters that otherwise would be interpreted as part of the HTML code itself. - `<` displays as `<` when rendered in a browser. You would use `<` in situations where you need to display raw HTML code or characters that have special meanings in HTML, like `<` (used for opening tags). For example, to display as text on a webpage (and not as an actual HTML element), you would write it like this: ```html <div> ``` This ensures that the browser does not try to interpret it as an actual HTML tag. Of course you can also use `` instead of ``. Just check your file in the browser and see what you like most. - Take care that your code is formatted properly. Do indentations when you start a new element inside another element. 
## Extra Credits
Give brief answers to the questions given in the file [SampleQuestions.md](SampleQuestions.md). When you make a pull request you will get feedback on your proposed answers and some extra points on the first quiz.
