**Activity 1: Reflection**
---

1. Define grit in your own words:

    Grit is the ability to stay committed to long-term goals, even when things get tough. It involves a combination of passion and perseverance, where you keep pushing forward despite setbacks, challenges, or feelings of frustration. It's about having the strength to continue working toward something meaningful, no matter how hard the journey may be.

2. Why is grit important to you?

    Grit is important to me because it allows me to achieve my long-term goals, even when they seem distant or difficult to reach. Without grit, I may give up too easily when faced with challenges. It helps me push through tough times and stay focused, which ultimately leads to personal growth, success, and fulfillment. Grit also teaches resilience, which is essential for navigating both personal and professional obstacles.

3. Write about a time you exhibited grit and succeeded at something difficult. What led to that success?

    It was when I had to study for a very difficult test. It was for a subject I didn't really care about, but I still wanted an A to make my report card look better. I was so tired, but I needed to study more. I kept pushing through and I got an A.

4. Recall a time you gave up prematurely. How did that make you feel?

    I gave up on making my own game, since it was very difficult and I couldn't realize the vision I had. Actually, it felt pretty good to get a little reality check and I tried to turn down my expectations for a bit and make another game. Now I'd say that I'm pretty good at Gamedev and the time I gave up helped me appreciate and respect game developers even more.

5. When you persevered with a challenging task, was the effort worth it?

    For now it was worth it, but if the tests continue to get more difficult, I need to find the balance between grades and sleep.
