# Social Media and the Brain

## Q4 - How does social media impact the Brain as it develops?

Everything about social media is designed to make you addicted to it.  
Most tech companies have entire departments dedicated to making an app more addictive.  
This especially impacts the younger generations, since the part of the brain that helps us process information and direct attention - the **Prefrontal Cortex** - has not finished developing for them yet.

### The Science Behind It

When we engage with social media, we receive frequent "**dopamine hits**" from likes, comments, and notifications. This constant stimulation can hijack the brain's reward system, making users crave more and more engagement. 

For younger individuals, whose brains are still growing, this can significantly affect their cognitive development, leading to issues with focus, decision-making, and impulse control.  

The **Prefrontal Cortex**, which helps us prioritize tasks and control impulses, isn't fully developed until around the mid-20s. Social media is often designed to maximize short-term engagement, leading to habits that are difficult to break, especially for younger users who are still learning how to regulate their emotions and attention.

### Questions

#### 1. What are some ways that you see social media taking advantage of you and those around you?

Social media platforms use algorithms to keep us scrolling endlessly, feeding us content that's tailored to keep us hooked. This constant cycle of information can leave us feeling like we need to check our phones repeatedly, making it harder to stay present and focused.  

Weâ€™re often exposed to unrealistic standards, which can affect our self-esteem and emotional well-being. Additionally, social comparison becomes more frequent, leading to feelings of inadequacy or anxiety.

#### 2. How do you think tech companies should react to the research and statistics we've discussed?

**Tech companies don't give a shit.** They're the ones responsible for this. While some companies have started to introduce "**digital well-being**" features, such as screen time reminders or notification settings, these measures are often insufficient.

The truth is, tech companies profit from user engagement, and any significant changes to reduce addiction could hurt their bottom line. If they were serious about user well-being, they would prioritize long-term mental health over short-term profits and make substantial changes to their algorithms to promote healthier use patterns.

### Conclusion

Social media isn't inherently bad, but when exploited in ways that target our brains' natural reward systems, it can lead to detrimental effects, especially for younger users. As consumers, it's important to be aware of these effects and advocate for changes that protect mental health.
