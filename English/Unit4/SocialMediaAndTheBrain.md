# Social Media and the Brain

## Q4 - How does social media impact the Brain as it develops?

Everything about social media is designed to make you addicted to it. 
Most tech companies have entire departments dedicated to making an app more addictive.

This especially impacts the younger generations, since the part of the brain that helps us process information and direct attention (the Prefrontal Cortex) has not finished developing for them yet.
