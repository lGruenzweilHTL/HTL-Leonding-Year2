# Page 55, Exercise 3a Step 2 Summary

## Similarities

Everyone I have interviewed spends over 5 hours a day on social media.
They also say, they write about 1000 text messages a month.

## Outliers

**Almir**
---
Almir has the least number of technological devices of all the people I interviewed.
He also claims, that he would last 1 month without any tech. Far longer than the other 2 people.

He is also the only person who prefers to write text messages over calling, apparently because he's scared of people.


**Matthias**
--
Matthias is the only person, who checks his email account everyday.
He also refuses to give concrete answers to my questions.
E.g. Q: **How many text messages do you write a month?**
A: ***a lot***
