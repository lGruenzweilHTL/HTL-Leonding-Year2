# Addiction - the basics:
- **Define the term addiction in your own words**.

    Being addicted means spending an unhealthy amount of time doing something and always thinking about it when you're not doing it.
- **Explain the difference between a habit and an addiction**.

    The main difference between a habit and an addiction is the level of control. 
    A habit is something you do regularly (sometimes even unconsciously).
    An addiction is characterized by a loss of control over the behaviour, even if it might be harmful.
- **Outline possible ways to overcome an addiction**.

    Just stop doing it
