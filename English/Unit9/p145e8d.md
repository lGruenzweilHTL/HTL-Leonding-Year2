Obviously it's great to help children in need. Who would think otherwise?

There are a lot of possible reasons, but I think that he may have seen some people in need as a kid and that inspired him to help them when he's older.

Yes, but not financially

## 4. Which charity organizations would you be willing to support financially?

I would be willing to support organizations that help children, such as UNICEF or Save the Children. I also support charities that provide food, clean water, education, and healthcare, like the Red Cross or Doctors Without Borders.
